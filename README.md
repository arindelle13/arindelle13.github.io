Synopsis: Solene Clemente was a typical Civil Engineering student who struggled to put up with her studies. Kung pwede ngang i-bake na lang ang napakaraming itlog sa test papers niya, ginawa niya na. At a young age, she experienced the harsh reality of life-poverty, abuse, and a broken family.

But, as someone who could see the bright side of everything, she knew she could make it with only her mother and best friend, Duke Laurence Sanders, whom she secretly loved.

Kahit pa naghihirap, basta kasama niya ang ina, kaya niya. Kahit pa madalas niyang hindi maintindihan ang lessons, ayos lang kasi may Duke naman na tuturuan siya. Na kahit gaano kalupit ang tadhana, patuloy siyang lumalaban sa buhay dahil may dalawang taong sumusuporta at nagmamahal sa kanya. She became too dependent on the love they could offer.

Because little did she know, like the sun she adored, she was destined to be alone.

Synopsis: Sea of Strangers by Lang Leav beautifully details the diverse emotions that are felt upon finding and losing love and losing and finding yourself in-between. Like many modern day poets, a majority of Leav's poetry is short conversational stanzas or compelling and straightforward one-liners.
